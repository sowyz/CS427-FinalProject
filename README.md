## Overview

For the Final Project 3D, we introduce Zombie Infinite, a FPS game where you - the player - is trapped in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. 
Unlike other zombie games where you are supposed to fight your way to survive and save the world, this game will give its players a peek of a real apocalypse where the zombies will never stop coming for you. 
Brace yourself for endless raids of zombies. They will kill you again, again and again, until you are finally good enough to discover the truth about the world you are in.
## Feature  and Technique
In this section, we will explain the details that made our game.

## 3D models and animations

### Gameplay review

To support a wider range of devices, we decided to use low-poly models for all objects in the game. 
This helps the game run smoothly even when a huge swarm of zombies exists in the player’s sight.

For the animations, we cover most of the basic animations such as shooting, bullets colliding, jumping, and reload. 
All animations are barely simple serving the same issue of performance. We have animations for shooting recoil. 
However, the aim won’t be affected by the animation to make the game easier mechanic wise.

### Game animation

Since our team is low on budget as well as short of artists, we decided to use free assets available on the market (see Resource References)

### Camera and control systems

The game uses a basic, familiar set of camera and control systems for FPS games. A first-person perspective camera with WASD movement control and mouse for turning, shoot, and aim.
Here is a list of controls:

#### Movements
 - W: Up
 - A: Left
 - S: Down
 - D: Right
 - Spacebar: Jump:
#### Shooting:
 - R: Reload
 - Q: Change weapon
 - Mouse ScrollL Change weapon
 - Left Click: Shoot
 - Right Click: Take aim 

### Lighting system

Zombie Infinite uses a simple single-source, ray-trace system that only takes into account object brightness and shadow. No lighting reflects  as well as shadow blurring is used.

### Gameplay

As a bunch of nerds, we, the developers, have experienced plenty of Zombie games. 
The backbone scene of those games usually end up with a good ending where you, as the player, find the solution to save humanity out of the Zombie apocalypse. 
But what if there is no end, what if we need to hopelessly fight for our life day by day in the middle of a bunch of crazy zombies, whose just a few days ago, 
is one of our friends, colleagues, or even family members.

Based on that dark fantasy, we decided to create Zombie Infinite, a game that has no difference to the average FPS game that we are all familiar with, 
except that instead of being on a mission to save the world, making friends and learning some life lessons about diversity along the way, 
you will be placed in a true endless hell that will crush your hope little by little

We planned to make the players to feel like they are a god at the start of the game 
(like Doom Guy in Doom series) but soon realize that the zombies seem to be endless and they soon outnumber the players, 
require them to really get good and have strict resource management to survive a long, exhausting, fight to the end, 
were the secret behind is reveal and a worthy reward is granted to the survivor

However, that ambition is way too large for the scope of this project so we decided to just make the first part: 
an endless shooting game where the zombies will never stop coming at you and your goal is to survive, or shoot down as many zombies as possible depending on the perspective.

### UI
For UI, Zombie Infinite provides a simple, yet helpful UI system that is straightforward and easy to use.
